A JavaScript for loop is a method to build a loop in the programming language of JavaScript. This method is the more conventional one. In my opinion, using this method in a practical way is a good exercise for someone who’s starting to learn about programming algorithms. I think this because it makes you grasp the concept of what really is a programming algorithm by showing you start to finish how a simple one works and what you need to tell the computer to do in order to get a specific task done.

A for loop needs three statements separated by semicolons and this is what each one of them is for:

1. is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
2. defines the condition for executing the code block.
3. is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

This means I can do something like declaring a variable called x with a value of 0 in the first statement. Remember, the first statement will only be executed one time and before the execution of the code inside the for loop, so this first statement is perfect for declaring a variable.

I’ll take the second statement, where I need to define a condition for the code block inside the loop to keep executing, and I’ll say that as long as x is less than number of elements in my array, the code block inside the loop should keep executing.

Finally, I’ll take the third statement and say that each time the code block inside the for loop executes, I want x to increase by one.

You might have already noticed what I’m trying to do here. This line of code allows me to go through every single element inside of my array because it will be looping the same block of code over and over for as long as there is elements inside my array. Beautiful, isn’t it?

I love this piece of code because you’re not vaguely telling the machine to take your array and look for each element inside of it. You’re figuring out how to do tell it to do it by telling it to do a series of steps that will end in the result you want.

Now, back on the loop, let’s get into an example of what you can do. Let’s say I want to see if there’s a string called “apple” in my array. To do this, since you’re already looping through the array, you would only have to add the block of code telling it to let you know if there’s a string called “apple”, like this:

This is the piece of code that got me into programming more than I already were. If you liked it, share this post and let me know what else you can do with a JavaScript for loop. I’d love to know!
